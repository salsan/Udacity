				<p>The African bush elephant has many distinctive features that sets it
					apart from the forest elephant. The bush elephant has few
					predators, but still remains to be labeled an endangered species,
					mostly because of poaching. These elephants are known for being hunted
					for their tusks, ears, feet, and meat, so the population of bush
					elephants in the world have been increasingly declining.
